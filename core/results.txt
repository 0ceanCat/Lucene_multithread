[Elevator music., elevator music, I really enjoy this piece. I used it in an elevator music gag.

I wish Balkan Beatbox would make the acoustic version available on mp3., I have for many years wished to hear Balkan music played &#34;straight&#34;, using traditional instruments,without concessions to pop fashion. Symphony orchestras don't really cut it, nor polka bands. Finally, who does it but Savall!  The quirky Balkan rythmns and textures finally get their glory. It's delightful!  And it's a much more up-beat album from Jordi Savall than he has done in a long time., Well, it is very difficult to explain ethno sounds of Serbia and Balkan Peninsula in just few words, but if you like Loreena McKennitt than you will like this music as well. The music is performed by the best quality of musicians currently available in Serbia including Madame Piano, Teodulija and other performers. There is a great new movement in Serbia to preserve the &#34;roots and mists&#34; of original ethno sounds. My starting point is the strong belief that in one way or another we are all an extension of each other's history, so come and explore the beauty of Serbian ethno sounds covering pre-Christian era, the era of never accepted Christianity in its full expression, the Slavic pagan roots and mists. Simply enjoy the uniqueness and originality of these ethno sounds from Balkan Peninsula., Good music!  When music was music., Beautiful, soothing, otherworldly music that just goes on and on. . .

Real country music from the good ole' country legends! Tracy Lawrence is great!, Country music seems to run in cycles these days.  There will be original country music, songs that draw people into the music, then country will drift into a period of wannabe rap or rock music.

[This song has a great beat and several catchy background instruments. Lyrics are typical. Haven't got sick of it yet., I find it almost unbelivable that the sounds these instruments make are being created by a human being.  Their mastery of their instruments is total, their product is moving, in several senses of the word., A rare album that hits several musical genres with a mix of bluegrass instruments, electric guitar, drums, and vocals, all done brilliantly., The quality of music is good, however, several instruments have been left out so it is almost like the version Keith Urban sings, but not quite., Eric aka J - Heir really is a performer, artist, brother in the Lord.

This is a very classic version with an old folksy sound.<br />Several different instruments add to the low key, hangout feeling., I listened to several renditions of this song with steel drums as the lead instrument. This was my favorite as it captured the Caribbean beat. I like the accompanying instruments too., I just steal amaize of how much talent this musicians have using brilliant scales and diamond and exelente vocal harmonys it is so much happening in each song if you listen several times you find more sounds and instruments., Fresh, catchy, adds much to the old favorites playlist. Grandkids didn't believe me when I told them it was only voices, no instruments. My grandson insisted on listening to cuts several times to listen more clearly. They vote thumbs ups., The musical instruments are random, and I found, unsettling. I've listened several times in differing situations, mindsets and times of day. It was never great or merely bearable. You cannot hear these random acts of violence upon your consciousness in the preview.  Just saying. Sorry so harsh.]
