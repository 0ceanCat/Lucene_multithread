[Came with a guitar solo right over the the guitar solo part. Worthless for my intended use guitar players stay away, Awesome guitar solo, Nice drawbar organ.  Vintage rock.  Corny lyrics.  The Neal Schon guitar solo shreds and should speak for itself!  No bass guitar solo, though., Great version of bewitched - Jim Hall's guitar solo and harmonies are wonderful examples of jazz guitar of its era., John Herington is guitar virtuoso paired with great keyboard backup on this cut.

[Very nice Christmas songs. The songs remind me why we celebrate Christmas. Very beautiful sound and songs to listen to during Christmas time., Great Christmas songs by Project 86.  Not the usual Christmas cover songs, they are their own lyrics, music, and style., This is such a great Christmas album. Most artist today mess up Christmas music. They try to fit it into genres where it doesn't belong. I feel that &#34;Very Merry Christmas&#34; is a timeless album. There are quite a few of his own Christmas songs on this album. Usually when an artist makes new Christmas songs I'm worried they'll mess it up. Not Dave Barnes. His Christmas songs will leave you asking why they aren't classic songs that are always played on the radio. Great Job Dave!, A great Christmas/seasonal CD, every Christmas song you could imagine and more at a great price.  If you like Christmas songs, this CD has them all., The is one of my favorite acapella Christmas songs.  Richochet weren't around for long, but this is one of best songs they did.

[Elevator music., I really enjoy this piece. I used it in an elevator music gag. I don't think this song is an elevator song, but it just has that relaxing, mellow vibe that elevator music has., A golden  tribute to elevator music everywhere!, very smooth semi-classical music.  a lot better that &#34;elevator&#34; music., I wasn't paying attention when I bought this. It's piano elevator music. It's great if your into piano elevator music, but I am not. I thought I was getting GD performances. I'll pay closer attention from now on., Elevator music was what I wanted, enjoyable and relaxing.  The music created a space for enjoying my reading experience, really!, Yeah, theyre covers.  But if you need it for general use, like as background music for a party or for a school, its perfect.  I looked for hours for Halloween music and this is the mmost for the money that doesnt sound like cheap midi music (aka elevator music), This is a short and sweet version of the famous theme song.  While all the pirate fans in our house still enjoy it, there are few moments where the sound touches on elevator music. Those moments pass though, and overall the version is still acceptable., It is great. I have a playlist for my son that plays ALL NIGHT LONG (he needs soft soothing sounds to sleep well) and this was a great addition for it. It is calming, pleasant and doesn't sound like elevator music. I would buy again from this vendor!, These albums bowled me over - it's &#34;Henry Mancini&#34; good.  I'm not a huge fan of &#34;exotic&#34; music, a little too sleepy, a little too &#34;elevator.&#34;  But especially on this album there are some tunes that really move, and the complextity of the arrangements are impressive, not to mention the bird of paradise and howler monkey  renditions.]
[Great balkan music, Russian/Balkan house /dance music style. For us americans who like House and Dance, Give her a try. You won't likely be dissappointed., I absolutely love this track, but I love the acoustic version, featured on the music video, even better. I wish Balkan Beatbox would make the acoustic version available on mp3., I have for many years wished to hear Balkan music played &#34;straight&#34;, using traditional instruments,without concessions to pop fashion. Symphony orchestras don't really cut it, nor polka bands. Finally, who does it but Savall!  The quirky Balkan rythmns and textures finally get their glory. It's delightful!  And it's a much more up-beat album from Jordi Savall than he has done in a long time., Well, it is very difficult to explain ethno sounds of Serbia and Balkan Peninsula in just few words, but if you like Loreena McKennitt than you will like this music as well. The music is performed by the best quality of musicians currently available in Serbia including Madame Piano, Teodulija and other performers. There is a great new movement in Serbia to preserve the &#34;roots and mists&#34; of original ethno sounds. My starting point is the strong belief that in one way or another we are all an extension of each other's history, so come and explore the beauty of Serbian ethno sounds covering pre-Christian era, the era of never accepted Christianity in its full expression, the Slavic pagan roots and mists. Simply enjoy the uniqueness and originality of these ethno sounds from Balkan Peninsula., Great Dinner Music Album, or just chilling out music! I would highly recommend this album for your music collection today!!!, This is good old music!  It's clean, fun and meaningful!  They don't make music like this anymore!  Love it!!

Who are these people that make this, like someone other than a family member would buy it., Worst album I have ever previewed. Thank God I did not buy the the silly thing. I think these idiots are deaf to good music. Would have given them a half star if possible. Do they actually think their reference to a song for the deaf is funny? Do not bother wasting your money on these idiots., The album isn't the best in the world definitely not the worst either.  Few songs on this album I didn't care for, but I enjoyed the majority of them, and loved a couple of the tracks.  Best Song on this is Evolution. Overall 2.8/ 5 skulls. I would suggest you listen to each song and just buy the individual ones that you liked note if you buy six or more of the tracks your better off just buying the whole album,, Pretty porous puppies passion Mike Doughty's psalms. A portfolio padded with powerful, progressive poems. Nonsensical at worst, preposterous at best., the story of my worst and yet best breakup. love the unclusion if wah wah watson on guitar. makes the song., Just plain stupid! This is the worst Britney song I have ever heard.  What was she thinking when she released this garbage?, This is the biggest Rip-Off ever.  Worst than a Garage band.  I hope I don't get fooled again - Look for anything marked re-recorded.]

Real country music from the good ole' country legends! Tracy Lawrence is great!, Country music seems to run in cycles these days.  There will be original country music, songs that draw people into the music, then country will drift into a period of wannabe rap or rock music.  During these periods I often turn off current country formats and return to contemporary music or oldies rock and country.  This is one of those country songs that bring me back from time to time and listen to new artists and current country music., Pure country music done pure country!!!  If you like real country, you need this!, True country music by a true country musician.]

This might have not been a big hit but still contains several good songs. I'm 22 but appreciate all of Cher's music!]
[This song has a great beat and several catchy background instruments. Lyrics are typical. Haven't got sick of it yet., This song was my introduction to Milquetoast & Co before venturing deeper into their catalogue. For a relatively unknown band, I was amazed at the sheer elegance, and utter talent possessed.  From horns, stringed instruments, and haunting lead vocals... it's a subtle mind-trip!  This song, as with several others, blends blues, folk, and a touch of rock perfect for kicking back and choosing your eyes with a cocktail., Disclosure: The oud is one of my favorite stringed instruments. If you like traditional instruments and funked-out middle Eastern orchestration you will love this tune. You cannot sit still for this!, It is ok. It really didn't wow me.
