[Came with a guitar solo right over the the guitar solo part. Worthless for my intended use guitar players stay away, Awesome guitar solo, Nice drawbar organ.  Vintage rock.  Corny lyrics.

[Very nice Christmas songs. The songs remind me why we celebrate Christmas. Very beautiful sound and songs to listen to during Christmas time., Not many Classical Christmas songs.  Christmas is a time to hear classical songs., Great Christmas songs by Project 86.  Not the usual Christmas cover songs, they are their own lyrics, music, and style., songs of christmas, Favorite Christmas songs, Love these Christmas songs. Who doesn't love Christmas music???? These people were fun to listen to their version of classic songs., Beautiful traditional Christmas songs!  : ), Christmas songs - these are great!, This is such a great Christmas album. Most artist today mess up Christmas music. They try to fit it into genres where it doesn't belong. I feel that &#34;Very Merry Christmas&#34; is a timeless album. There are quite a few of his own Christmas songs on this album. Usually when an artist makes new Christmas songs I'm worried they'll mess it up. Not Dave Barnes. His Christmas songs will leave you asking why they aren't classic songs that are always played on the radio. Great Job Dave!, Irish lit on Christmas songs....good]
[Elevator music., elevator music, I really enjoy this piece. I used it in an elevator music gag. I don't think this song is an elevator song, but it just has that relaxing, mellow vibe that elevator music has., A golden  tribute to elevator music everywhere!, Okay,  so I really like elevator music!, very smooth semi-classical music.  a lot better that &#34;elevator&#34; music., I wasn't paying attention when I bought this. It's piano elevator music. It's great if your into piano elevator music, but I am not. I thought I was getting GD performances. I'll pay closer attention from now on., Elevator music was what I wanted, enjoyable and relaxing.  The music created a space for enjoying my reading experience, really!, love this movie the music definately makes this movie so heart wrenching it is very soothing and not elevator music, Love, love love.  I get inquiries by younger people in the elevator who has never heard Santana's music.]
[Great balkan music, Great album.  Balkan influenced American Folk., If there's one genre of music I absolutely love with all of my heart and soul, it's &#34;fusion&#34; music. That is, music born from a combination of other genres. Having heard only one other album by Reptile Palace Orchestra from circa 2000 (and loving it), I was super intrigued to hear what they sounded like in 2012. I am happy to report they sound as eclectic and fusion-y as ever!<br /><br />You can hear a little bit of everything on this album, from Balkan and Middle East tunes to Salsa and Brazilian folk, all blended up in a soup made from RPO's special broth of jazz and cabaret leanings. Each song is part-entertainer, part-virtuoso, drenched in a fun, slightly weird sense of humor (Skeleton Dance, for example!).<br /><br />If you're a fan of modern folk music, or if you're shopping for something outside the usual pop/rock vicinity, RPO are probably right up your alley! Recommended for fans of Boiled In Lead, Vagabond Opera, Mes Aieux, and the like!, I only recently discovered the Orthodox Celts, but they have existed in one form or another for 20+ years (not only that, but they remain a top band in their home country and surrounding areas). It just goes to show how far-reaching the influence and likeability of Celtic (and especially Irish) music is! This particular gem dates back to about 1997 and hasn't lost one drop of appeal in all that time.<br /><br />The instruments are lively and have solid technique. You can hear, just barely, an oh-so-slight flair of Balkan or Slavic musical tendencies (in the banjo and guitar parts, and also a little in the group chorus), but that only strengthens this song. The vocals (especially the lead/solo) are sung with a tried-their-darn-best Irish accent, which is variously charming and borderline amusing. All in all, definitely well worth the $1 to download. This would be a great introductory song to new listeners.<br /><br />Don't let the far-flung background of the band put you off. These guys mean it. This version of this already-lovely tune is among the best I've heard, and I'm not the only one to say so. Irish music has appeal in the most unlikely places (although perhaps Serbia is not so unlikely if you consider the historical and even cultural similarities it shares with Ireland). It's a genuine shame that CDs by this band are so rare (even on a worldwide basis). I suspect they could gain legions of new fans if only a company would reissue them. Until then, we shall have to hunt for them with the magic of the mp3., Good music!  When music was music., Old school music when music was music, Beautiful, soothing, otherworldly music that just goes on and on. . . Wonderful dinner music, music to relax by, background music, or music when you need to focus.  Incredible compilation of music!, Music is music, and this music is good., Glorious music from the days when music was music, I love music any kind of music, but not noise. He sings music.]

Real country music from the good ole' country legends! Tracy Lawrence is great!, Country music seems to run in cycles these days.  There will be original country music, songs that draw people into the music, then country will drift into a period of wannabe rap or rock music.  During these periods I often turn off current country formats and return to contemporary music or oldies rock and country.  This is one of those country songs that bring me back from time to time and listen to new artists and current country music., Pure country music done pure country!!!  If you like real country, you need this!, True country music by a true country musician., Kacey Musgraves may single handedly keep country music country, One of his best songs.

[This song has a great beat and several catchy background instruments. Lyrics are typical.

It's one of the best versions I could find.

One of the best and I listened to several versions., Beautiful song. The instruments are so strong., The best musicianship ever, on bluegrass instruments!, Great melody and background/instruments with interesting lyrics., Disclosure: The oud is one of my favorite stringed instruments.

Buy the record, put on some headphones and enjoy the experience of a really unique record..., The production is top notch. Drums recorded at Black and Bluhm studios in Denver. Mixed and mastered by Masaki Liu., I really enjoy this CD for my yoga practice. More yoga studios should have this kind of music to play., Classic doesn't fit. These are just old.
