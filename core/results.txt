[Great balkan music, The style \\"Balkan\\" has evolved radically over a few years. In 2000, there were only these gypsy brass bands from former Yugoslavia and Romania, which were known from the movies of Emir Kusturica, e.g. Boban Markovic Orchestra, Fanfare Ciocarlia and Goran Bregovic. The Original Style \\"Balkan Brass\\" is crazy, exotic and very, very quick. This gypsy-punk with the extremely hectic winds is a dazzling live concert experience and has brought many new fans to the Balkan music, also outside of Balkans. Then, a few years later, DJ Shantel came with his modern form of the \\"Balkan Beats\\". Thereby the Balkan music succeeded over here from concert halls into the radio and the discotheques. People came into contact with Balkan music now, who never before had heard Gypsy bands live. Mostly they were delighted with this rousing brass band music. In all major cities music clubs emerged, which focused on \\"Balkan Beats\\". The audience wanted to listen 'his' wild Balkan hits and to turn euphoric for hours. But the DJs were easily bored to put on always the same pieces alternately from Goran Bregovic and Shantel. Many DJs are musicians themselves and experiment with other styles. 2010 then was the starting point to develop the new, the third variant of Balkan music \\"Balkan-Electro\\", a mix of house and techno with traditional Balkan brass elements, a very weird melange of old and new. DJ ralph \\"von\\" richthoven from Bremen observed this trend and released two double sampler with club-oriented Balkan music. The first compilation \\"The Balkan Club Night, Vol. 01\\" (2008) starts with Balkan brass classics, to present thereafter the development to modern Balkan Beat. The new, second compilation \\"Balkan Club Night, Vol. 02\\" begins, where Vol. 01 ends: with the transition from \\"Balkan Beats\\" to \\"Balkan-Electro\\" and of course, briefly reviews the tried and true classics like Fanfare Ciocarlia, Boban I Marko Markovic Orkestar and Goran Bregovic. The currently most important artists of the BalkanBeats scene also are presented: Analogik from Copenhagen, DJ Pony from London, Barobax from Tehran, Dunkelbunt from Vienna, Shantel from Frankfurt and Riva Starr from London.  But the focus of \\"The Balkan Club Night Vol. 2\\" is clearly on the all-new productions, where is fused consistently House with Balkan brass. The entire 2nd CD side is dedicated to the future of Balkan music: \\"Balkan-Electro\\". Many of the mostly very young musicians are from the Balkans and they previously have presented their tracks only in the internet on special sites. Not only these bright young musicians  adopt this violent pumping sound, on the track list also appear the names of established House-DJs from the hottest clubs on Ibiza, such as Jason Rivas, Ian Oliver or Balearic Soul, who have discovered \\"Balkan\\" for themselves as well. This new style urges with a vengeance in the clubs of the metropolises. In 2011 one will hear \\"Balkan-Electro\\" world-wide in every scene club. Umek, with his hit \\"Novi Sad\\", is only the spearhead of the wild horde, that will come up to us., Great album.  Balkan influenced American Folk., This Polish-Ukrainian band creates a fascinating ethnic fusion drawing heavily from traditional Gypsy & Balkan folk, mixed with modern Eastern European jazz, classical forms, and, um, Balkan wedding music... Really draws you in and inspires close listening. Great arrangements, fine musicianship. Just awesome!, Balkan music is some of my favorite music ever, and this was my first CD of Balkan music. Ruth Yaakov has a wonderful, haunting voice, and the sephardic influences are a bonus as I am jewish. I would recommend this music to ANYONE, it is magical and great for a party or just an evening alone., Fourth album by this 13 piece brass band of varying sized \\"truba's\\" (horns) playing the Balkan music that Balkan brass bands are known for but with an American sensibility (all members are Americans, typically without Balkan heritage).  More raucous than Goran Bregovic and more authentic.  Better than the native brass bands thanks to training and superior North American recording capabilities.  If this doesn't get your feet moving nothing will.  This album's selection is, as would be expected, heavy on coceks (c's pronounced ch), with a sprinkling of other Balkan dance standards (kolo, reka, pembe and levendikos). For listening and dancing, a treat., Russian/Balkan house /dance music style. For us americans who like House and Dance, Give her a try. You won't likely be dissappointed., Wonderful composing. There is a wide variety of sounds and textures, vocal, instrumental, etc. 76 minutes of music.

The CD was created and produced by members of the Eastern European Folk Life center, eefc.org, which promotes Balkan music in North America. Try it, you won't be disappointed! ---Riccardo, This recording is part of a CD set which is a great sampling of Balkan Music and a great place to start if you want to take a quick musical tour of the Balkans and hear what appeals to you.

This crap is rap/ pop music., I do miss the Country Western heydays of the early 1990's when Country Music still did good music.<br />Back in the old days Country Music was two genres mostly Cowboy Western Music and Honky Tonk Music.<br />For some reason the Honky Tonk Music overlapped The Cowboy Western Music side of Country Music.<br />Because of that reason Country Music is less Country and more Pop because of it., The best of old country rock n roll fusion, with a little bit of blue grass.

[This song has a great beat and several catchy background instruments. Lyrics are typical.

The two instruments played seperately give a very nice touch., There are few instrumental versions of Petula Clark’s hits. This one really sounded great. It incorporates several instruments you don’t usually hear like a xylophone., Upbeat, happy music to listen to while on hold. Each song has several different instruments. Relaxing music that's not boring and not likely to be controversial., It is a great combination of talent and execution of  instruments and dynamics excellent work, it takes several time to really catch all the iniquities of their music, Song has a good mix of instruments versus the usual guitar bass and drums.  Harmonica blasting in several points gives it a different feel.  Jazzy? Blues?  Maybe.  Rocking?  YES., A wonderful recording of several expert violinists playing wonderful instruments. The fidelity is excellent and the miraculous &#34;highs&#34; are truly magnificent. A overall selection of Paganini's works that will amaze you for hours on end.]
