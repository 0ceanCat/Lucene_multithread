[Greatest rock & roll band ever!, Greatest rock guitar solo ever!, one of the greatest rock groups ever!, One of the greatest early rock and roll songs ever., The Rolling Stones playing live are the greatest rock band ever., Well done,  great to see Michael McDonald back in the mix. Fantastic remix of all there greatest hits plus one from last year's new album.  Contry and rock fans will love this album., INXS is one of the greatest '80's rock bands ever, and this set gives all their music in one place.  The remastering on the set is really great too., Some Ty Segall fans might be put off by the fact that Manipulator is more polished than his prior efforts.  I personally think its great.  Manipulator sounds either like a lost disc from the famous Nuggets collection or a greatest hits from a late 60s/early 70s British rock band.  There's a variety of short, upbeat rock tunes in various retro styles.  A great party album and a great driving album.  One of my favorite new releases so far this year., Hmmmm........where to begin with this album. This is most definitely not Nickelback's best album to date. In fact, most longtime fans of the band will undoubtedly, like me, dislike the majority of this record. Nickelback has often been heavily criticized for being too reliant on a post-grunge rock formula for their albums; however, after a couple spins, there is no worry of that with this record.<br /><br />There is exactly three songs on this album that I liked. The greatest majority of the record seemed like Nickelback was trying way too hard to front as a glossy, not to hardcore pop band trying to appeal to a much wider audience. I won't damn a band for trying to bring in more fans, but man, most of the songs on the album lack any edge or grit that often defined the band's earlier sound. The production on the album also often times makes you forget that you're even listening to a rock record; you'd swear this is Maroon 5 or something else that's too top 40 for my taste. Heck, sometimes Chad Kroeger even sounds like he's auditioning to be a pop crooner on this album, it gets that bad at points. I hate to totally bash a band for seeking out new ways to make rock music, and I'm not simply a rockophile in any way, but this album is simply way too far of a departure for me to get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe in time this album will grow on me and make me see the true Nickelback vision, but as for tight now it's definitely one of my least favorite Nickelback albums to date.<br /><br />If you're an old school Nickelback fan then you'll probably hate this album immensely. However, if you enjoy your rock a little on the softer, and slightly country side of things, then you'll probably get a little more out of this release. Just be warned...this isn't a typical Nickelback record., One of the greatest songs to come out of the 60's, one of the greatest instrumentals of all time. Not blues, not rock, more an early form of jazz fusion. Also a seminal underground rock album of the 60's, loved by college students.]
